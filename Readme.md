## My Personal Portfolio

This is a portfolio website to display select projects I have completed as well as my highlighted abilities.

The site is in a perpetual state of change. I have rewritten it several times. Most recently I rewrote all the layout using flexbox instead of bootstrap. I did keep bootstrap for a few things like scrollspy and tooltips. I also redesigned the layout of my projects section to give room for better explanations. I have updated everything for accessibility to ensure even those with screen readers or otherwise impaired can still use the site ( as long as they aren't on IE of course ;) ).

When building the portfolio I tried to follow Google's best practices for optimizing page speed. Initially the score was an embarrassing 8/100. Currently the score is at 90/100 for desktop. I still host the site on a free dyno through Heroku so initial load can be slow because the dyno shuts down after a period of inactivity.

Some of the projects listed haven't been updated and maintained recently. For the best reflection of my abilities review my latest repos to see what I am working on. Of course I would encourage you to reach out to me and we can talk. My email is listed to the left in my profile.
