## My Personal Portfolio

This is a portfolio website to display select projects I have completed as well as my highlighted abilities.

When building the portfolio I tried to follow Google's best practices for optimizing page speed. Initially the score was an embarrassing 8/100. Currently the score is at 90/100 for desktop. I still host the site on a free dyno through Heroku so initial load can be slow because the dyno shuts down after a period of inactivity.

Some of the projects listed haven't been updated and maintained. For the best reflection of my abilities review my latest repos to see what I am working on. Of course I would encourage you to reach out to me and we can talk.
