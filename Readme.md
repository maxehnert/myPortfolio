## My Personal Portfolio

This is a portfolio website to ~display select projects I have completed as well as my highlighted abilities.~ have a presence online. I killed off all the projects and and fancy things about this site to make it plain HTML with text.

~The site is in a perpetual state of change.~ I have rewritten it several times.

I have too many other projects I'm working on to keep this one up to date with what I'm doing and focused on. This site can stand on its own without needing iteration or tweaking.
